        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>My name is Min Thant Ko, but my friends call me MT. I'm originally from Myanmar and currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Chiang Mai University in Thailand. Passionate about technology and innovation, I enjoy exploring various programming languages and developing creative solutions to real-world problems. My interest in software development began early, and studying in Thailand has broadened my perspective, introducing me to diverse cultures and advanced technology. Outside academics, I love collaborating on coding projects, especially those that involve web development and AI. In my free time, I also enjoy reading about tech trends, listening to music, and playing football, which helps me stay balanced and focused. I aspire to become a skilled software engineer, contributing to impactful projects that can benefit communities back home in Myanmar and beyond. My journey so far has been exciting, and I'm eager to see what the future holds in this dynamic field.</p>
